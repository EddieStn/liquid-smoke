# Design and build
### This is a Business to Customer( B2C ) focused application. The intent of this website is to sell candles and essential oils to customers for a single payment at checkout.

## The planning for this project was based on this idea: 

* As a customer: 
    * Open the app to see the products,
    * Add items to the basket,
    * Checkout,
    * Pay and provide delivery details,
    * Get a confirmation email with my order.
    * See past orders
    * Repeat

* Navbar changes
    * I was having responsiveness issues with my original navigation design so I took inspiration from Boutique Ado 

# Testing

## Lighthouse
* Desktop before and after

* Mobile before and after

## Validation
* HTML
* CSS
* JShint
* pep8online

## Automated testing TDD
- To create automated tests, I had to comment out the postgres DATABASE_URL as I don't have permissions to create TDD, so used the django default database, sqlite3, for testing

## Manual testing
- Testing checkout functionality with coupons expired/invalid/active to be rendered in the order_details view, then deleted from the session

## Responsive

### No problems found when building the app and manually checking for responsiveness with chrome dev tools

To generate a multi device mockup I used [Techsini](https://techsini.com/multi-mockup/index.php)
To ensure my website is fully responsive I used [responsivedesignchecker](https://responsivedesignchecker.com/)

# Bugs

### Checkout
* After a successful order, hitting the back button from the order_detail page leads to an error in the browser
    * Fixed by adding an exception to the stripe intent
```
InvalidRequestError at /checkout/
stripe.error.InvalidRequestError: Request req_upHWpena88utjx: This value must be greater than or equal to 1.


try:
    intent = stripe.PaymentIntent.create(
        amount=stripe_total,
        currency=settings.STRIPE_CURRENCY,
    )
    except stripe.error.InvalidRequestError as e:
    # Invalid parameters were supplied to Stripe's API
    return redirect(reverse('home'))
```


### Basket 
* Adding an offer item will not add it with the discounted price
    * Fixed by changing the model to include a discounted_price field and the view_basket to check for the discounted_price
* Hitting enter on the quantity field in the basket & clicking Remove will reduce the quantity by 1
    * Fixed the remove button by updating the view to only delete the item
    * Fixed the quantity issues with javascript event listeners in view_basket.html
* The basket will always have one empty product displayed
    * Fixed by adding a check to make sure `product_id is not None` before creating the BasketItem object.
* First added item to the basket will always be 1 regardless of set quantity
    * Fixed by modifying the add_to_basket to check if the BasketItem object already exists, and update its quantity accordingly.


* Submitting a review form will trigger error from the basket form (quantity field required)
    * Fixed by wrapping both form handlers in an if statement `if request.method == 'POST':`
    * Added a hidden input field to both forms `if 'review_form' in request.POST:` & `if 'basket_form' in request.POST:`
    * Added to each form button tag the name attribute to check for hidden input `<button type="submit" name="review_form ( / basket_form)">Submit</button>`
* Clicking an <a> tag (eg. "All products") wouldn`t open the link, but right click > "open in a new tab" works
    * Fixed by removing `data-toggle="dropdown"` that was needed for the account dropdown menu
* The header is covering the body of the website
    * having `html {height: 100%}` and `body {height: calc(100vh - any size)}` doesn't fix it.
    * Fixed by addig `padding-top: 145px;` to the body element


## Django notes

* When changing a model and applying migrations you get an error message to provide a default value or set null=True
    * If you have data stored in your database
        * If you don't want to have those values in your fields, add a default="" to your field, makemigrations>migrate, then remake your model as needed and makemigrations>migrate again
    * If you don't have any data stored
        * Simply comment out your models or delete your migrations files (except __init__.py) and migrate again
        * rm db.sqlite3 > python manage.py makemigrations > python manage.py migrate

# Development and Deployment
## Local development

## Heroku deployment
### The site was deployed via Heroku. The live link can be found here - [Liquid Smoke](https://liquid-smoke.herokuapp.com/)

## Deployment checklist

## Forking a repository
### A fork is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.
1. On GitHub.com, navigate to https://github.com/EddieStn/liquid-smoke.
2. In the top-right corner of the page, click Fork.

## Cloning your forked repository
### Right now, you have a fork of the liquid-smoke repository, but you do not have the files in that repository locally on your computer.
1. On GitHub.com, navigate to your fork of the liquid-smoke repository.
2. Above the list of files, click Code.
3. Copy the URL for the repository.
4. Open Git Bash.
5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory.
6. Type git clone, and then paste the URL you copied earlier. It will look like this, with your GitHub username instead of YOUR-USERNAME:
   - git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/liquid-smoke
7. Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.
